# Email RAG Assistant - Changelog

## Version 3.3.1 - January 3, 2025 - OPENAI API PARAMETER FIXES FOR GPT-5

### üêõ Critical Fixes
- **Fixed OpenAI API Errors for GPT-5 compatibility**:
  1. **max_tokens parameter**: 
     - GPT-5 requires `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
     - Changed from `max_tokens: 1000` to `max_completion_tokens: 1000`
  2. **temperature parameter**:
     - GPT-5 only supports default temperature (1.0), not custom values
     - Removed `temperature: 0.7` parameter to use default
     - Updated `/emailogan-web/app/api/generate/response/route.ts` (lines 150-151)

### üéØ Impact
- Email response generation now works correctly with GPT-5
- No more 500 Internal Server Errors from unsupported parameters
- Maintains same 1000 token limit for response generation
- Uses GPT-5's default temperature for consistent output

## Version 3.3.0 - January 3, 2025 - ENHANCED STYLE MATCHING & GPT-5 UPGRADE

### üöÄ Model Upgrade
- **Upgraded to GPT-5 model** for improved response generation
  - Updated `/emailogan-web/app/api/generate/response/route.ts` (line 144)
  - Updated `/response_generator.py` (line 22)
  - Added model logging confirmation: "Using model: gpt-5"

### üéØ Critical Style Matching Improvements

#### Issue Identified
- Embeddings were being retrieved but not effectively utilized for style matching
- Generated responses weren't mimicking the distinctive writing style of stored emails (e.g., Spock's logical, analytical tone)
- Email body content was being truncated, losing crucial style information

#### Prompt Engineering Overhaul
- **Completely rewrote system prompts** for stronger style emphasis:
  - Added "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - YOUR PRIMARY TASK" section
  - Explicit requirements to "EXACTLY match the writing style"
  - Detailed style analysis checklist (vocabulary, tone, structure, personality markers, etc.)
  - Reinforcement in user prompt: "You MUST write in the exact style shown"

#### Vector Storage Enhancement
- **Increased email body limit** from 1000 to 4000 characters
  - Ensures complete writing style is captured, especially for detailed/technical emails
  - Critical for preserving distinctive voice patterns and unique expressions

### üìä Enhanced Logging & Debugging

#### Added Comprehensive Logging
- **Vector Storage Logging**:
  - Email sample previews during storage
  - Body length tracking
  - First 200 characters preview for verification
  
- **Retrieval Logging**:

- Better handling of technical or specialized writing styles
- Clear logging to verify embeddings are being used effectively

## Version 3.2.0 - January 3, 2025 - EMAIL REPLY GENERATION FIXES

### üö® Critical Issues Fixed

#### Email Generation Now Creates Replies (Not Rewrites)
- **Issue**: System was rewording/rewriting the input email instead of generating replies
- **Root Cause**: Vague prompt "draft email responses" was ambiguous
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote prompt engineering to explicitly generate REPLIES
- **Impact**: System now correctly generates responses TO emails, not rewrites OF them

### üéØ Prompt Engineering Improvements

#### Rewrote System Prompts (route.ts:74-95)
```typescript
// Before: Ambiguous
"You are an AI assistant helping to draft email responses"

// After: Explicit
"You are an AI assistant that generates REPLY emails. 
Your task is to write a RESPONSE to an email that will be provided."
```

#### Added Clear User Prompt Framing
- Explicitly frames input as "Please generate a reply to the following email:"
- Adds separator and clear directive: "Generate your REPLY below:"
- Removes ambiguity about whether to rewrite or reply

#### Enhanced Context Usage
- When knowledge base is enabled, context now explicitly states:
  - "CONTEXT - Previous emails showing your writing style and tone"
  - "Study these examples carefully and mimic the writing style"
- Increased retrieval from 3 to 5 emails for better style matching
- Better formatting of example emails with clear labels

### üìä Enhanced Logging & Observability

#### Added Comprehensive API Logging
- Entry point logging: "Generate API called"
- Request parameter logging with prompt length
- OpenAI API call tracking:
  - "Using knowledge base - generating embeddings..."
  - "OpenAI embedding generated"
  - "Querying vector database..."
  - "Found X matching emails"
  - "Calling OpenAI for response generation..."
- Detailed error logging with stack traces

#### Why Logs Weren't Showing
- Previous error handling only logged generic messages
- No logging before/after OpenAI calls
- Missing console.log statements throughout the flow
- Now tracks every step of the generation process

### üé® UI/UX Improvements

#### Clarified Input Field
- Changed label from "Email Prompt" to "Email to Reply To"
- Updated placeholder: "Paste the email you want to reply to here..."
- Increased textarea from 4 to 8 rows for better visibility
- Added helper text: "When enabled, uses your stored emails to match your writing style"

### ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

#### Created Test Script
- `test-email-generation.js` for validating fixes
- Tests both with/without knowledge base
- Validates responses are replies, not rewrites
- Checks for proper addressing of sender

### üìù Key Changes Summary

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Complete rewrite to explicitly generate replies
2. **Logging**: Added 10+ new log points for full observability
3. **UI Clarity**: Better labels and helper text
4. **Context Handling**: Improved how embeddings inform style
5. **Error Details**: Enhanced error messages with full details

### üöÄ Impact

Users will now see:
- Proper email replies addressing the sender (e.g., "Dear Sean,")
- Responses that acknowledge the content of the original email
- Style matching from stored emails when knowledge base is enabled
- Clear logs in Vercel showing all OpenAI API calls
- Better understanding of what the system is doing

## Version 3.1.0 - January 3, 2025 - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT FIXES

### üöÄ Critical Production Fixes

- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between Streamlit app using `email-rag-index` and Next.js using `email-embeddings`
- **Solution**: Standardized both apps to use `email-rag-index`
- **Impact**: Vector storage now works end-to-end in production

#### Date Serialization Fixed  
- **Issue**: `e.date.toISOString is not a function` error during email processing
- **Root Cause**: Date objects losing type information during JSON serialization
- **Solution**: Added type checking to handle both Date objects and date strings
- **Impact**: Email processing completes successfully without errors

#### Authentication Streamlined
- **Feature**: Auto-login with default password for testing
- **Implementation**: Login form automatically submits on mount with `blocklogan1988`
- **UI Update**: Shows "Auto-logging in for testing..." during authentication
- **Purpose**: Reduces friction during development and testing cycles

### üîß Enhanced Debugging Capabilities

```javascript
// Before
const name = indexName || process.env.PINECONE_INDEX_NAME || 'email-embeddings';

// After  
const name = indexName || process.env.PINECONE_INDEX_NAME || 'email-rag-index';
```

#### Date Handling Fix
```javascript
// Now handles both Date objects and date strings
const dateStr = email.date instanceof Date 
  ? email.date.toISOString() 
  : new Date(email.date).toISOString();
```

### ‚úÖ Current Production Status
- **Uploads**: Working - 24 files upload successfully
- **Processing**: Working - OpenAI embeddings generated correctly
