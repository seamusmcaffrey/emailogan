Mr. Scott,

Your unconventional solution to the plasma flow restriction was... highly illogical. According to all known engineering principles, reversing the polarity while simultaneously increasing pressure should have caused a cascade failure.

Yet it worked. Efficiency improved by 19.4%.

I have spent 2.7 hours attempting to mathematically model your solution. The equations suggest a 97.3% probability of catastrophic failure. Reality disagrees.

Your explanation that "she just needed a wee bit of coaxing" lacks scientific rigor but apparently possesses practical merit.

I am forced to conclude that your intuitive understanding of the Enterprise's systems transcends pure logic. This is... most unusual.

And somewhat enviable.

Commander Spock
