Mr. Sulu,

Your botanical specimen from Omicron Ceti III exhibits fascinating properties. The plant's ability to thrive in 0.7G gravity while maintaining Earth-normal cellular structure defies 3 known laws of xenobiology.

Further analysis reveals:
- Photosynthetic efficiency: 47% (Earth plants average 3-6%)
- Growth rate: 2.3cm per day
- Unique protein synthesis suggesting medicinal applications

Your hobby has yielded scientific value. This discovery could revolutionize agriculture on low-gravity colonies.

I have allocated additional lab space for your botanical experiments. Your success rate of 78.4% in cultivating alien flora exceeds that of many professional xenobotanists.

Most impressive, Lieutenant.
