Nurse Chapel,

The medical supply inventory discrepancy has been resolved. We were missing 14 vials of Cordrazine - a 0.7% variance from expected stock.

Investigation revealed Dr. McCoy had relocated them to Emergency Kit 7 without updating the database. His explanation that he "had a hunch we might need them" is illogical but historically accurate - his hunches prove correct 68.2% of the time.

I have updated the inventory system to automatically track McCoy's "intuitive redistributions." This should prevent future discrepancies.

Your attention to detail in discovering this variance is commendable. Maintaining 99.97% inventory accuracy across 3,847 items demonstrates exceptional organizational capability.
