Mr. Scott,

I have been reviewing the warp drive performance logs from the past mission quarter. My analysis indicates we could achieve a 4.7% improvement in antimatter consumption efficiency through recalibration of the dilithium matrix.

The mathematical model I have developed suggests adjusting the intermix ratio to 1:1.0023 rather than the standard 1:1. While this deviation is minimal, the cumulative effect over extended warp travel would be substantial.

I am aware of your skepticism regarding theoretical modifications to "your engines," as you call them. However, the logic is sound and the mathematics irrefutable.

I propose we conduct a controlled test during our next maintenance cycle. The probability of adverse effects is less than 0.02%.

Please advise on your availability to discuss implementation parameters.
