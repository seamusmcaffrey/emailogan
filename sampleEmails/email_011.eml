Doctor,

Your assertion that Vulcan meditation techniques are "mystical nonsense" is both illogical and contradicted by empirical evidence. Studies show meditation reduces cortisol levels by 23%, improves cognitive function by 17%, and enhances immune response by 11%.

These are measurable, quantifiable medical benefits. Your continued skepticism appears to be based on cultural bias rather than scientific analysis.

I have taken the liberty of sending you 47 peer-reviewed studies on meditation's physiological effects. I calculate a 0.03% probability you will read them, but logic demanded I make the attempt.

Your emotionalism on this subject is... curious for a man of science.
