Captain,

During yesterday's away mission, you violated 7 standard protocols:
- Removed communicator during negotiation (Protocol 7.3)
- Engaged in hand-to-hand combat despite diplomatic status (Protocol 12.1)
- Consumed alien food without medical screening (Protocol 9.7)
- Plus 4 additional infractions

Statistically, your approach should have resulted in mission failure 86.2% of the time. Yet you achieved all objectives and improved relations with the Tellarites.

This pattern repeats across 73.4% of our missions. Your disregard for protocol correlates with a 91% success rate - a statistical anomaly I cannot explain through logic alone.

I am forced to conclude that human intuition, while chaotic, has merit in certain scenarios.

Nevertheless, I must continue to object for the record.

Commander Spock
