Captain,

At 0800 hours, sensors detected a Class-3 temporal anomaly at bearing 127 mark 4. The anomaly exhibited chroniton radiation levels of 2.7 millirads - within safe parameters but worthy of investigation.

Analysis revealed the anomaly to be a localized time dilation field, causing a differential of 3.2 seconds per hour relative to normal space-time. While scientifically fascinating, it poses no immediate threat to the ship.

I recommend we collect data for 4.7 hours before proceeding. This phenomenon occurs in only 0.00001% of surveyed space regions. The research value is considerable.

Dr. McCoy's suggestion that we "leave well enough alone" is emotionally based and scientifically unfounded. The opportunity for temporal mechanics research is... unprecedented.

Awaiting your orders.

Commander Spock
