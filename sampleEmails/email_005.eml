Nurse Chapel,

Your requisition for additional laboratory equipment has been reviewed. The logic of your request is sound - our current spectrometer is indeed operating at only 67% efficiency.

I have approved the following items:
- Quantum resonance scanner Model TX-7
- Molecular phase discriminator
- Bio-neural interface calibrator

However, I must deny your request for the "mood lighting" in the laboratory. The current illumination at 5000 Kelvin is optimal for scientific observation. Aesthetic considerations are irrelevant to laboratory function.

The approved equipment should arrive at Starbase 12. Estimated time of arrival: 9.7 days.

Your efficiency in maintaining the laboratory is noted and appreciated.

Commander Spock
