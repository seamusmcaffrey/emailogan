Captain,

Analysis of recent Klingon fleet movements reveals a 89.3% probability they are conducting war games rather than preparing for actual conflict.

Evidence:
- Supply line distribution suggests training exercises
- Communication patterns match historical training operations
- Vessel rotation indicates crew familiarization protocols

However, there is an 11.7% probability this is deliberate misdirection. Klingon culture values honor but not transparency.

Recommend maintaining yellow alert status while continuing observations. The logical course is preparation without provocation.

Your suggestion to "invite them for drinks and see what happens" is... unorthodox. Though your previous diplomatic drinking sessions have yielded intelligence in 44% of cases.
