Enterprise Personnel,

I will be conducting a seminar on "Logical Approaches to Workplace Efficiency" tomorrow at 1400 hours in Conference Room 3.

Topics will include:
- Eliminating redundancy in daily tasks (potential 23% time savings)
- Logical decision matrices for problem solving
- Statistical analysis for performance optimization
- The illogic of procrastination

Attendance is voluntary. However, those who attend show a 31.2% average improvement in performance metrics within 30 days.

Dr. McCoy's previous description of my seminars as "dryer than Vulcan's Forge" is irrelevant. Emotional engagement is not required for information transfer.

Light refreshments will not be served, as eating during lectures reduces attention by 8.7%.
