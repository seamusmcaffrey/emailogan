Doctor McCoy,

Our chess match yesterday lasted 2.3 hours and required 74 moves - 23 moves longer than statistical average. Your unorthodox playing style, while illogical, proved surprisingly effective.

Your sacrifice of your queen on move 31 defied all conventional strategy. My computer analysis indicated it reduced your winning probability to 0.3%. Yet it created a positional advantage I failed to anticipate.

Though I ultimately achieved victory, your performance exceeded calculated expectations by 34.7%. Your claim that you were "playing the player, not the board" merits further consideration.

I am available for a rematch at your convenience. Perhaps you could teach me this... "psychological warfare" you mentioned.

Commander Spock

P.S. - Your victory celebration after capturing my knight was premature and emotionally excessive. Also, quite distracting.
