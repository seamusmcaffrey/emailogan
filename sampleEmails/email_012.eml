Captain,

Long-range sensors have detected unusual subspace signatures along the Romulan Neutral Zone. Pattern analysis indicates a 72.4% probability of cloaked vessel movement.

Based on historical data and game theory modeling, I calculate three possible Romulan objectives:
1. Intelligence gathering (38.2% probability)
2. Testing Federation response times (41.1% probability)  
3. Prelude to larger incursion (20.7% probability)

The logical response would be to maintain current heading while increasing sensor sweeps by 200%. This demonstrates awareness without provocation.

Your tendency toward more... aggressive diplomacy has proven effective in 67.3% of similar situations. However, logic suggests restraint until we have additional data.

I await your decision.

Commander Spock
