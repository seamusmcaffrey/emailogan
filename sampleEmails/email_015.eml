Captain,

While I cannot quantify your "gut feeling" regarding Ambassador Shran, behavioral analysis does support your suspicion.

The Ambassador exhibited 7 micro-expressions indicative of deception during our meeting:
- Elevated blink rate (32% above baseline)
- Rightward eye movement during 3 factual statements
- 0.3-second hesitation before answering direct questions

Additionally, his antenna positioning suggested defensive posturing - a trait observed in only 12% of diplomatic exchanges.

Your intuition, while not logical, has proven correct in 71.4% of similar situations. I recommend discrete surveillance and verification of his stated agenda.

Fascinating how human instinct occasionally aligns with logical analysis.
