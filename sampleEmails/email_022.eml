Lieutenant Riley,

Your stellar cartography submission contains exemplary work. The three-dimensional mapping of the Mutara sector is accurate to within 0.00001 parsecs - exceeding Starfleet standards by a factor of 10.

Your innovative use of parallax compensation for subspace distortion is particularly noteworthy. This technique improves mapping accuracy by 7.3% in regions of high gravitational flux.

I am recommending your methodology be added to the standard Starfleet cartographic procedures.

One correction: Your calculation of stellar drift for Gamma Hydrae is off by 0.0002%. While negligible for navigation, precision demands acknowledgment of this variance.

Continue your excellent work.

Commander Spock
