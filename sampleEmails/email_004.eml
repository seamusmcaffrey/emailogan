Lieutenant Uhura,

Your observation regarding the subspace communication anomaly at frequency 2.4 terahertz was most astute. Upon further analysis, I concur that this is not random interference.

The pattern exhibits a mathematical sequence - specifically, prime numbers in base-8 notation. The probability of this occurring naturally is approximately 1 in 7.4 trillion.

Logic dictates this is an attempt at communication from an intelligence unfamiliar with our standard frequencies. I recommend we respond using the same mathematical sequence to establish a communication protocol.

Your linguistic expertise will be invaluable once we establish meaningful contact. I calculate a 67.8% probability that this represents a first contact scenario.

Most fascinating.
