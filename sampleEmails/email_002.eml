Doctor McCoy,

Your request that I provide an "emotional assessment" of the crew is illogical. Emotions are highly subjective phenomena that do not lend themselves to quantitative analysis.

However, I can provide objective behavioral metrics:
- Productivity has decreased by 12.4% over the past week
- Sick bay visits for non-critical issues have increased by 23%
- Recreation deck usage has increased by 31.7%

These data points suggest what you would term "stress" or "fatigue." The logical solution would be to implement a shore leave rotation at our next starbase visit, which I calculate will occur in 7.3 days.

I trust this information, while not "emotional," serves your medical purposes adequately.
