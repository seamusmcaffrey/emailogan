Captain,

I have completed my analysis of the planetary survey data from Sigma Draconis VI. The results are, as humans might say, fascinating.

The atmospheric composition shows 78.2% nitrogen, 20.9% oxygen, and trace amounts of argon - remarkably similar to Earth standard. This similarity occurs in only 0.0003% of surveyed M-class planets, making it statistically significant.

Furthermore, the geological scans indicate extensive dilithium deposits in the northern hemisphere. I calculate a 94.7% probability that these deposits are commercially viable.

I recommend we proceed with a landing party investigation. The logical course of action would be to establish a research station at coordinates 47.3°N, 122.1°W, where the deposits are most concentrated.

Your decision on this matter would be appreciated at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully,
Commander Spock
Science Officer, USS Enterprise
