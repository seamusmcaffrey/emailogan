Lieutenant Sulu,

Your execution of evasive pattern Delta-7 during yesterday's encounter was exemplary. My analysis shows you improved upon the standard maneuver by 2.3 seconds, while maintaining structural integrity within acceptable parameters.

The slight modification you made to the roll axis - increasing it by 3.7 degrees - was a logical adaptation to the specific threat vector. This demonstrates both tactical acumen and practical application of theoretical knowledge.

I am forwarding this commendation to Captain Kirk for inclusion in your service record. Your probability of promotion has increased by approximately 14.2% based on this performance metric alone.

Continue this level of excellence.

Commander Spock
