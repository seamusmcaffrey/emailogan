Doctor McCoy,

Your request to learn the Vulcan nerve pinch is illogical. The technique requires:
- Vulcan hand strength (3.7 times human average)
- Precise knowledge of neural pathways
- Mental discipline you have repeatedly demonstrated you lack

Your assertion that you could use it to "shut Spock up when he gets too logical" is both impossible and inappropriate.

However, your medical knowledge of human nervous systems is extensive. With significant practice, you might achieve a 0.003% success rate on human subjects.

If you insist on this illogical pursuit, I will provide instruction. Schedule 47 hours of meditation training first. Your current mental state resembles what you colorfully call "a bag of cats."

Commander Spock
