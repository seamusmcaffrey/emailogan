Lieutenant Kyle,

Your management of the transporter systems continues to be satisfactory. Pattern buffer degradation remains at 0.0001% - well within acceptable parameters.

However, I have noted you are using 12.3% more energy than necessary during dematerialization sequences. By adjusting the phase transition coils by 0.7 degrees, you could achieve identical transport quality with improved efficiency.

Additionally, your innovation of pre-warming the pattern buffers has reduced transport time by 0.8 seconds. While minimal, this improvement could prove crucial in emergency situations. I have added this procedure to the standard operations manual.

Logic suggests implementing these modifications during the next maintenance cycle.

Commander Spock
